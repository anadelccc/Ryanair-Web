# Ryanair-Web
A copy of the Ryanair Website. Mobile and desktop version. 

What can you find in this file? 
A few animations; a drop down arrow, a line that changes its size and a window that pulls up when you hover the mouse. 
More than only one navbar and footer. Lots of icons and svg images. 
A complex grid due the amount of sections and sub-sections. 
A mobile responsive website like the authentic one.

Â¡Enjoy!
